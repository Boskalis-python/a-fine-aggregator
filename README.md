# A-fine Aggregator

This repository contains the code of an aggregation algorithm for use in 
preference-based design and decision-making. In short, the following two starting 
principles apply to this algorithm:

1. it should reflect relative scoring as encountered in actual design and 
decision-making practice.
2. it should adhere to the governing mathematics in a one-dimensional affine space, 
which is the mathematical model applicable to preference score(s).

A more detailed description of the mathematics behind the algorithm can be found in the 
included PDF: [a-fine-aggregator-description.pdf](a-fine-aggregator-description.pdf).
